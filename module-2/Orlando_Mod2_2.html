        <p class="intro">
            I am father of three. I started my software development path back in 2016 where I attended University Of Phoenix.
            I obtain a certificate of software development and was to afraid to take a chance on the industry because I felt like
            I didn't know enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far I've spent 6 years in the warehouse industry, working my way up the ladder to become a supervisor.
           <span class="sentence">Now I am back to take another shot a becoming a developer!</span> I really like the creative you can have when your creating softwares and web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although my major is in software development, I must say that I truly enjoy web development more. I think it's the instance gratification you receive once you write a line of code
            and the changes happen instantly. I am excited to learn both parts of development (software and web apps).
        </p>

            I am really into sports and my favorite sport is football. Before it was basketball but now I feel like football has won the top spot. My football team is the Philadelphia Eagles 
            and for basketball the Miami Heat. I do like other sports such as baseball, hockey, soccer, but I could only watch those games live. My plan for the 2023 football season is to travel to 
            Philadelphia and watch an Eagles game with my wife.
